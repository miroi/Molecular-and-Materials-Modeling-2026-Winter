Ethane C-C bond energy with ASE
===============================

The C-C bond dissociation energy in ethane is cca 348-377 kJ/mol.

It is calculated by comparing the total energy of optimized ethane with two methyl radicals,
often using methods like DFT (e.g., B3LYP) or CCSD(T) with basis sets like cc-pVTZ. 

The C-C equilibrium bond length is 1.53-1.54 A.
