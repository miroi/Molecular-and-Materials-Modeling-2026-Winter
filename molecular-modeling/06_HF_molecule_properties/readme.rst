Properties of HF molecule
=========================

Exercise
--------
Compute some properties of HF molecule. 

These are equilibrium geometry, vibrational frequency, thermodynamic properties (enthalpy, entrophy),
electric properties (dipoment moment, static dipole polarizability).

Employ methods in MOPAC (PM7, PM6) and in NWChem (DFT, CCSD) programs.
For NWChem, use different DFT functionals and basis sets (CCSD).

Put obtained results into a big spreadsheet Table.

Challenge
~~~~~~~~~
For the MOPAC program, employ different semiempirical Hamiltonians. 

With NWChem (DFT, CCSD methods), use different DFT functionals and different basis sets.
