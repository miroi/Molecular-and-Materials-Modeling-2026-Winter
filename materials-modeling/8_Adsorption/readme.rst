Adsorption on the surface
=========================

Adsorption of H atom on a piece of graphene (C8).

Initial structures are read from vasp geometry files. 
The H atom is placed into a middle of  cubic box.

step 1
~~~~~~
relaxation.py - optimizes the H@C8 geometry

step 2
~~~~~~
energy_h.py - computes the energy of H atom

step 3 
~~~~~~
energy_c.py - computes the energy of C8 surface

Adsorption energy = E(C8) + E(H) - E(H@C8) =  -1303.645828 -12.559508 -( -1319.069236) eV
Adsorption energy = 2.8639 eV 

Google AI: The adsorption energy of a single Hydrogen (H) atom on pristine graphene is approximately 0.67 to 1.0 eV (chemisorption).
Binding Energy: Typically 0.67–1.0 eV, with some studies reporting up to ~1.9 eV.

Challenge
---------
Modify Python script to perform the relaxation of the C8 slab and calculate new adsorption energy.

Increase the ecutwfc parameter to see if this improves the binding energy of H on C8.
